# Bet Monitor
Live bet monitor & feed built for online gambling operator.

- Online gambling website had an outdated and errored monitoring program of bets coming through. 
- When a bet is placed, function within the system generates a file containing summary of bet details.
- Old program used to display these files had become obsolete (was made in 2004), odds traders & support staff would not be able to run through bet feed - the 'tree' layout was limiting.
- Auto-generated text files were displaying a lot of unneeded information, traders would struggle to 'at a glance' understand the wager info.
- Finally, the main limitation is that the betting 'database' containing full user, bet and event information is fully encrypted.

Below is the old program used (hidden customer refs):

The solution was to create an updated version of this that would:
- Make it easy for office workers to view the feed of incoming bets
- Produce snapshot reports on the daily activity
- Find and display betting patterns
- Other various QoL improvements for office staff

Bet Monitor contains two Python files that use tKinter UI-
Bet Processor
  Read folder containing raw bet files (.txt) that are generated by the website when a client places a bet, gets a knockback (rejected bet), or sends a SMS bet request
  Process (parse) bet files and organise
  Export files to a JSON database by day
